### The Written Works Modpack Repository
From the project page:
>Welcome to the Written Works. An overhaul modpack made to be a modern rendition of RLCraft, Better Than Wolves, and Gregtech. Your objective is to escape this world, and that comes with serious gameplay. All processes attempt to replicate real-life, and therefore does not require the simple act of smashing items together in a crafting table.
>  
>Whether it be fabric-making, farming, carpentry, or thaumaturgy. Everything is fleshed-out in content and neatly integrated together to make a beautiful tapestry. Nothing is left out in the equation of the tech-tree.

The purpose of this repository is to contain all versions of the WRITTEN WORKS builds, either experimental or release. These modpacks are stored in `.mrpack` formats, a Modrinth compatible file format. If you wish to see the curseforge-specific `.zip` files, you can visit the [Curseforge page](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/written-works) (Not Available).
